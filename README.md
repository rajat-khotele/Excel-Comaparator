'Excel Comparator.py' is for simple excel files. There should be atleast one column with unique values.
It can also handle non-unique values in that column but fails in certain cases.


'Excel Comparator Ver(2).py' & 'Excel Comparator ver(3).py' can handle excel files if there are one or more columns with non-unique values.
Only difference is in their output files.
